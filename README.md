### README for **BreastImplantDX: AI-Powered Diagnostics for Breast Implant Health**  

---

## Overview  
This repository is dedicated to our research project: **"Prognosis and Complications of Breast Implants using Mammography and Clinical Data: A Machine Learning Approach."**  
The goal of this project is to enhance the diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of mammography and ultrasound imaging for breast implant complications using advanced machine learning techniques.  

---

## Objectives  
- Develop machine learning models to detect breast implant complications (e.g., rupture, capsular contracture) and predict long-term outcomes.  
- Provide a cost-effective alternative to MRI by improving the diagnostic power of mammography and ultrasound.  
- Create a robust dataset combining imaging and clinical data for model training and validation.
